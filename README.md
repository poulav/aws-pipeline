# AWS Pipeline Implementation Project

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of an AWS Pipeline using a powerful combination of AWS services including CodeBuild, CodePipeline, EC2, Docker, and S3. 

## Overview
AWS Pipelines are essential for automating the development, deployment, and management of applications in the cloud. This repository provides a step-by-step guide and code samples for setting up an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that leverages the capabilities of AWS to streamline your software development process.

## Features
- **CodeBuild**: Utilize AWS CodeBuild to compile, test, and package your application code.
- **CodePipeline**: Create a seamless CI/CD pipeline that automates code delivery and deployment.
- **EC2**: Deploy your application to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for scalable and reliable hosting.
- **Docker**: Containerize your application with Docker for easy deployment and portability.
- **S3**: Store artifacts, logs, and other resources securely in Amazon S3.
